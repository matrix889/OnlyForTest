The first line is a positive integer $T$($T \leq 20$), represents the number of case. The next $T$ blocks follow each indicates a case.

Each case starts with a positive integer $n$.\\
In the next line, there are $n$ integers. The $i^{th}$ number mean $a_{i}$.

For 80\% of cases, $n \leq 1000$.\\
For 100\% of cases, $n \leq 100000$, $-1000000000 \leq a_{i} \leq 1000000000$.
