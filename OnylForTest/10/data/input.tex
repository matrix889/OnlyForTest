There are multiple test cases.The first line is an integer $T$. $T$ means the number of the test cases.

In each test case, the first line is 10 integers $(A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},A_{4},A_{5},A_{6},A_{7},A_{8},A_{9},A_{10})$. $A_{i}$ is the number of the coin which values i. The second line is an integer $N$. ($T \leq 20$, $Ai \leq 100000$, $N \leq 100000$)
