The first line is a positive integer $T$($T \leq 20$), represents the number of case. The next $T$ blocks follow each indicates a case.

Each case starts with two positive integers $n$ and $M$.\\
In the next line contains $n$ positive integers indicate the sequence of $a$.

For 80\% of cases, $n \leq 100$ and $a_{i} \leq 100$.\\
For 100\% of cases, $n \leq 1000$ and $a_{i} \leq 1000$, $M \leq 1000000000$.
