Give you a sequence $a_{1},a_{2}, \cdots ,a_{n}$.

You can divided a integer into two pairs, but one integer should be divided only once and each pair of it must be greater than $0$. For example, you can divide $3$ into ($1$ | $2$), but you can't divide it into ($1$ | $1$ | $1$) or ($0$ | $3$). Dividing an integer $x$ cost $x$ unit of money.\\
After all you dividing operator, all the adjacent integer will merge into one integer and become a new sequence $b$. If one integer divided into two pairs, they are considered non-adjacent.

For example, sequence 2 5 3 7. We split $3$ and $2$, cost $5$ unit of money.
And it become 1 | 1 5 2 | 1 7, and then become sequence $b$ : 8 8 2.
If the maximum integer of $b$ must be smaller than or equal to a given integer $M$, what's the minimum cost? If it's no valid solution, output $-1$ as the answer.
