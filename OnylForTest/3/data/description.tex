Give you a sequence $a_{1},a_{2}, \cdots , a_{n}$.\\
We define $sum(i,j) = \sum_{x=i}^{j}a_{x},i < j$\\
If we put all of $sum(i,j)$ in a sequence $B$ with $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ elements and sort them from small to large. Now give you a positive integer $K$. Can you tell me the $K^{th}$ element in $B$?
