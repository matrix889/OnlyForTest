The first line is a positive integer $T$($1 \leq T \leq 20$), represents the number of case. The next $T$ blocks follow each indicates a case.

Each case starts with two positive integers $N$ and $M$, which indicates the number of boys and girls respectively. Boys are numbered from $1$ to $N$. Girls are numbered from $1$ to $M$.\\
In the next line, contains $N$ positive integers $c$, the $i^{th}$ integer indicates the money that the boy with number $i$ will give to Great Master if he can fall in love with a girl.\\
In next $N$ lines, each line contains $M$ integers, which is $0$ or $1$. If the number of the $j^{th}$ integer in $i^{th}$ line is $1$, it means the boy i can fall in love with girl j. Otherwise, they will never go together.

For 80\% of cases, $0 < N,M \leq 100$.\\
For 100\% of cases, $0 < N,M \leq 300$, $c \leq 100000$.
