The first line is a positive integer $T$($1 \leq T \leq 20$), which represents the number of case. The next $T$ blocks follow each indicates a case.

Each case starts with a string $s$.\\
In next line contains an integer $M$.\\
In next $M$ lines, each line begin with an integer $op$($1 \leq op \leq 2$).\\
If $op$ = 1, there are an integer $p$ and a lower case letter $q$ after $op$, means that you should change the $p^{th}$ character of $s$ to $q$.\\
If $op$ = 2, there is a lower case letter $q$ after $op$, means that you should print the number of $q$ in string $s$.

For 70\% of cases, the length of $s \leq 1000$, $M \leq 1000$.\\
For 100\% of cases, the length of $s \leq 100000$, $s$ only contains lower case letter, $0 \leq M \leq 100000$, $0 \leq p < N$, $q$ must be lower-case letter.
